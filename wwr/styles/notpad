1) What did you learn from the websites on careers in web design and development? 
<!--I learned that web development has a much wider pay scale than your typical software engineer. 
I was also surprized that the salary topped out at less than $250,000 or $75/hr
There were some interesting careers that I had thought of before like a "Digital Content Curation Senior Manager" 
who vets the types of media used on a site or certain sites under the same corporate umbrella.

    <h1>My name is Zack Gillingwater, I'm a business major and four years ago I started a business building, upgrading computers. I also offer some repair services and setup offices for small firms, but that's more on hold while I'm studying full time. I want to learn more about the creation of software and in my opinion website creation seems like the best transition going from hardware to software.
        I learned a little HTML in 2022, but I'm very rusty now so I'd say my knowledge about web design is a solid 5/10. </h1>
